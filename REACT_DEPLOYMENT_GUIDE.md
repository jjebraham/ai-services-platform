# React Application Deployment Guide

## Current Status
The website `https://kiani.exchange` is currently serving a static HTML file instead of the React application. The React application has been successfully built and is ready for deployment.

## Built Files Location
The React application has been built and the files are located in the `dist/` folder:
- `dist/index.html` - Main HTML file
- `dist/assets/index-Bu7KP86Z.css` - Compiled CSS
- `dist/assets/index-ZxIL9Uz6.js` - Compiled JavaScript

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Manual Deployment via Server Access
1. Connect to the server: `ssh root@185.199.109.153`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd /root/`
3. Pull the latest changes: `git pull`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Build the React application: `npm run build`
6. Restart the server: `pm2 restart all` or `node production-server.js`

### Option 2: Using the Production Deployment Script
1. Connect to the server: `ssh root@185.199.109.153`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd /root/`
3. Make the script executable: `chmod +x deploy-production.sh`
4. Run the deployment script: `./deploy-production.sh`

### Option 3: Manual File Copy
If SSH access is limited, copy the built files manually:
1. Copy `dist/index.html` to the server's root directory
2. Copy `dist/assets/` folder to the server
3. Update the server configuration to serve from the `dist` folder

## Server Configuration
The `production-server.js` is configured to:
1. Serve static files from the `dist` directory first
2. Fall back to `index.html` in the root directory
3. Handle API routes under `/api/`

## Verification
After deployment, verify the React application is working by:
1. Visiting `https://kiani.exchange`
2. Checking that the page loads React components (not static HTML)
3. Testing navigation between pages
4. Verifying API endpoints work

## Troubleshooting
- If the site still shows static HTML, ensure the `dist` folder exists on the server
- Check that the server is serving from the correct directory
- Verify that the build process completed successfully
- Check server logs for any errors

## Files Modified
- Created `ErrorBoundary.jsx` (missing component)
- Fixed `AdminDashboard.jsx` (removed duplicate code)
- Built React application successfully
