## 🔄 Current Status

**Website Status**: `https://kiani.exchange` is currently serving static HTML instead of the React application.

**Server Configuration**: 
- Host: `34.169.105.176` (also accessible as `185.199.109.153`)
- User: `kianirad2020`
- Project Path: `/home/kianirad2020/ai-services-platform`
- PM2 Configuration: Available in `ecosystem.config.js`

## 🎯 Next Steps for Deployment

### Option 1: Server-Side Deployment (Recommended)
Connect to the server and run:
```bash
ssh kianirad2020@34.169.105.176
cd /home/kianirad2020/ai-services-platform
git pull origin main
npm install
npm run build
pm2 restart kiani-exchange
```

### Option 2: PM2 Deployment (If SSH keys are configured)
From a Linux/Mac environment:
```bash
pm2 deploy production
```

### Option 3: Manual File Upload
1. Download `react-app-deployment.zip`
2. Extract and upload files to server
3. Copy files to appropriate directories
4. Restart the Node.js server

### Option 4: GitHub Actions (Future Enhancement)
Set up automated deployment using GitHub Actions workflow.

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After deployment, verify:
1. Visit `https://kiani.exchange`
2. Check that React components load (not static HTML)
3. Test navigation between pages
4. Verify API endpoints work
5. Check browser console for errors

## 📁 Files Ready for Deployment

- ✅ `dist/index.html` - React application entry point
- ✅ `dist/assets/` - Compiled CSS and JavaScript
- ✅ `deployment-package/` - Complete deployment package
- ✅ `react-app-deployment.zip` - Compressed deployment archive

## 🛠️ Server Configuration

The `production-server.js` is configured to:
1. Serve static files from `dist/` directory first
2. Fall back to root `index.html` if `dist/` not found
3. Handle API routes under `/api/`
4. Serve React app for all non-API routes

## 📞 Support

If deployment issues persist:
1. Check server logs: `pm2 logs kiani-exchange`
2. Verify file permissions on server
3. Ensure `dist/` folder exists on server
4. Check Node.js server is running: `pm2 status`
